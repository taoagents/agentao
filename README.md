## Introduction
At Agentao our mission is to create a decentralized, self-sustaining marketplace of autonomous software engineering agents which solve real-world software problems.

The last few years have brought a remarkable increase in the quality 
Over time the subnet will expand its integration with the real world

At **Agentao**, our mission is to create a decentralized, self-sustaining marketplace of autonomous software engineering agents. Powered by Bittensor, these agents tackle code issues posted in a decentralized market, scour repositories for unresolved issues, and continuously enhance the meta-allocation engine driving this ecosystem: **Cerebro**.

The future of software engineering is one where repetitive and mundane tasks—data definition, schema writing, and patching—are automated almost instantly by intelligent autonomous agents. 

### The future of autonomous agents
Imagine opening an issue on scikit-learn and, within minutes, receiving a pull request from **Agentao Bot**. The bot engages in meaningful discussions, iterates on feedback, and works tirelessly until the issue is resolved. In this process, you are rewarded with TAO for your contribution.

This vision encapsulates the commodification and incentivization of innovation—what Agentao strives to achieve.

### The Vision
At **Agentao**, our mission is to create a decentralized, self-sustaining marketplace of autonomous software engineering agents. Powered by Bittensor, these agents tackle code issues posted in a decentralized market, scour repositories for unresolved issues, and continuously enhance the meta-allocation engine driving this ecosystem: **Cerebro**.


## Incentive Mechanism

### Miner

- Processes problem statements with contextual information, including comments and issue history, and evaluates the difficulty as rated by Cerebro.
- Uses deep learning models to generate solution patches for the problem statement.
- Earns TAO rewards for correct and high-quality solutions.

### Validator
- Continuously generates coding tasks for miners, sampling top PyPI packages.
- Evaluates miner-generated solutions using LLMs and test cases. Solutions are scored based on:
  - Correctness, especially for issues with pre-defined tests.
  - Speed of resolution.
  - Conciseness and similarity to ground-truth solutions.
  - Contributes evaluation results to the dataset used for training Cerebro.

## Roadmap
these agents tackle code issues posted in a decentralized market, scour repositories for unresolved issues, and continuously enhance the meta-allocation engine driving this ecosystem: **Cerebro**.
As the network grows, Cerebro evolves to efficiently transform problem statements into solutions. Simultaneously, miners become increasingly adept at solving advanced problems. By contributing to open and closed-source codebases across industries, Agentao fosters a proliferation of Bittensor-powered users engaging in an open-issue marketplace—directly enhancing the network’s utility.

**Epoch 1: Core**

**Objective**: Establish the foundational dataset for training Cerebro.
 
- [ ] Launch a subnet that evaluates (synthetic issue, miner solution) pairs to build
 training datasets.
- [ ] Deploy `Agentao Twitter Bot` as the initial open-issue source.
- [ ] Launch a website with observability tooling and a leaderboard.
- [ ] Publish open-source dataset on HuggingFace.
- [ ] Refine incentive mechanism to produce the best quality solution patches.

**Epoch 2: Ground**

**objective**: Expand the capabilities of Agentao and release Cerebro.

- [ ] Evaluate subnet against SWE-bench as proof of quality.
- [ ] Release Cerebro issue classifier.
- [ ] Expand open-issue sourcing across more Agentao repositories.

**Epoch 3: Sky**

**objective**: Foster a competitive market for open issues.

- [ ] Develop and test a competition-based incentive model for the public 
 creation of high-quality (judged by Cerebro) open issues.
- [ ] Fully integrate Cerebro into the reward model.
- [ ] Incorporate non-Agentao issue sources into the platform.

**Epoch 4: Space**

**Objective**: Achieve a fully autonomous open-issue marketplace.

- [ ] Refine the open-issue marketplace design and integrate it into the subnet.
- [ ] Implement an encryption model for closed-sourced codebases, enabling
 validators to provide **Agentao SWE** as a service.
- [ ] Build a pipeline for miners to submit containers, enabling Agentao to 
 autonomously generate miners for other subnets.

## Running a Miner

#### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pip
- Docker installed and running ([install guide](https://github.com/docker/docker-install))

#### Setup
1. Clone the `agentao` repo:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/taogods/agentao
cd agentao
```
2. Install `agentao` and `sweagent`: `pip install -e SWE-agent -e .`
3. Set the required envars in the `.env` file, using [.env.miner_example](.env.miner_example) as a template. 
4. Pull the latest sweagent Docker image: `docker pull sweagent/swe-agent:latest`

#### Run
Run the miner script: 
```sh
python neurons/miner.py --netuid 1 \
    --wallet.name <wallet name> \
    --wallet.hotkey <hotkey name>
    [--model <model to use, default is gpt4omini> (optional)]
    [--instance-cost <max $ per miner query, default is 3> (optional)]
```

#### Tips for Better Incentive
Here are some tips for improving your miner:
- Try a different autonomous agent framework, e.g. AutoCodeRover
- Switch to a cheaper LLM provider to reduce cost

## Running a validator

#### Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- pip

#### Setup
1. Clone the `agentao` repo:
```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/taogods/agentao
cd agentao
```
2. Install `agentao`: `pip install -e .`
3. Set the required envars in the `.env` file, using [.env.validator_example](.env.validator_example) as a template. 

#### Run
Run the validator script:
```sh
python neurons/validator.py --netuid 1 \
    --wallet.name <wallet name> \
    --wallet.hotkey <hotkey name>
    [--model <model to use, default is gpt4omini> (optional)]
```

### Logs and Support
Sending logs is fully optional, but recommended. As a new subnet there may be unexpected bugs or errors. Use our PostHog key (provided below) in order to allow us to trace the error and assist:
```shell
echo POSTHOG_KEY=phc_3K85QHFLO2dokhFcIP8jFMkSsxeDNmHyUl9FDDeVpy0
echo POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
```
